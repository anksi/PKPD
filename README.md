Pharmakokinetics and Pharmacodynamics models
Jist of PKPD modelling …

**Pharmacokinetic modelling:** Modelling the concentration of the drug when administered at particular dose.

PK models,

1. Non-compartmental models,
2. Compartmental models, 
  One compartment models: Assumes drug distributes uniformly (simple and robust model),
  Two compartment models: Assumes drug distributes separately in central (blood) and peripheral (tissue) compartments, (easy to explain), 
  Physiologically biased PK models: Use organ specific parameters for realistic drug simulations,
3. Stepwise covariate modelling (SCM) to identify influential patient factor. 

**Pharmacodynamic modelling:** Modelling the effect of drug at a given concentration.

PD models,

1. Direct effect model: These models assumes drug effect directly follows concentration in the effect compartment,
Emax model: Describes maximum attainable effect (Emax) and the concentration at which half of the concentration can be achieved (EC50), 
E=Emax×C/EC50+C 
2. Sigmoid emax model (Hill equation): 
3. Indirect response model,
4. Turnover models:
5. Delay models:
6. Receptor binding models:
7. Effect compartment models:
8. Tolerance feedback model:
